    Integer Types

    F prefix is a floating point number, 64 is used for double precision, and 32 is used for single precision.
    I prefix means the variable is signed.
    U prefix means the variable is unsigned.

    The number is the amount of bytes it takes up in memory.
    Usize and isize are dynamic, they depend on the Operating System, if the OS is 32 bit, usize and isize will be u32 and i32. Same thing for 64 bit OS's.
